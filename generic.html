          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Subroto from Patna, Bihar,
            and I'm thrilled you're here. A bit about my journey: I completed my
            schooling in Patna and recently graduated with a BCA degree from
            CIMAGE Professional College, a three-year undergraduate program
            focusing on programming, networking, design, and applied
            mathematics. When I finished high school, I was uncertain about my
            career path and sought advice from family and mentors. It was my
            elder brother who encouraged me to pursue specialized courses in the
            field of computers rather than following a general course of study.
          </p>
          <p>
            My initial interest in technology led me to choose BCA, even though
            I started college with no prior knowledge of programming. In my
            first semester, I was introduced to Python, which sparked my
            enthusiasm for programming, even though I didn't yet own a laptop.
            The hands-on experience was limited to theory, but by the second
            semester, I had my own laptop and delved into C programming. I
            worked diligently on about 100â€“120 pattern-printing exercises, which
            helped me build a strong foundation in loops and logical thinking.
            This experience made learning C++ and Java in my third semester
            relatively easy, as I could quickly grasp the syntactical
            differences based on my solid understanding of C. The real turning
            point came in the fourth semester when I discovered Data Structures
            and Algorithms (DSA). Realizing the importance of DSA in the tech
            field, I proactively began learning it through YouTube tutorials
            even before it was formally introduced in class. Though college
            primarily focused on theoretical knowledge, I was eager to build
            practical experience. By the fifth semester, I practiced DSA
            extensively on platforms like LeetCode, Coding Studios, and
            GeeksforGeeks. Additionally, although the syllabus included accounts
            and networking, which were outside my comfort zone as a science
            student, I managed to score well in accounts. Finally, in my sixth
            semester, I embarked on my capstone project with two classmates.
            Together, we built *VidesiVilla*, a MERN stack project, where I and
            another team member worked on the front end, while the third member
            handled the backend. Although we faced numerous challenges due to
            time constraints and being new to the technology stack, we sought
            help from resources like Stack Overflow and various tech
            communities. Through persistence and collaboration, we successfully
            completed the project within the given timeframe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although web development wasn't part of our curriculum, my journey
            into building projects led to a genuine interest in the field. I
            started creating small projects on my own, which allowed me to gain
            hands-on experience and enhance my skills in web development. Thank
            you for taking the time to read about my journey!
